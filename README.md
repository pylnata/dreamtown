This is landing page for fake tour agency, created by me to play around with(learn/test) modern html/css/sass and all this stuff.
Some features that I used in this project: 
* CSS-grid, flexbox for layouts;
* cool animations and effects for transformations;
* project structure based on 7-folder pattern for SASS files;
* effective settings for develop mode/build process; 
* BEM methodology for css naming;
* page meets the requirements of responsive design, including techniques for creating responsive images;
